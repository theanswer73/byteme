// There are a row of n houses,

// The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. 
// You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
// The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. 
// For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; 
// costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, 
// and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
// Note:
// All costs are positive integers.

// Input contains N rows and each row have three costs with respct to three colors
